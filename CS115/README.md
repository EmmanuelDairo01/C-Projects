# CS 115 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
This reposittory conatins project created during the process of understanding object oriented programming where i utilized concepts such as data abstraction, classes, composition and inheritance, subtyping, dynamic binding, polymorphism and dynamic memory management.

This repository conatins 10 codes which are listed below:

Assignment1: This assignment aims to reverse the digit inputed by the user.This code focuses on the principles of functions.

Assignment2: The function checks to see if a world is an palindrome. This utilizes arrays and functions.

Assignment3: The code helps to identify duplicate values in a 2 Dimensional Array.

Assignment4: This code checks checks if a number is a mulitiple of 7, 11 or 13 and if the sum of the digits is odd or even and if its a prime number. This codes utilizes class to reduce redundant code

Assignment5: This code takes an array and uses selection sort in other to sort the array elements in ascending order

Assignment6: This code takes an array of positive integer values and usesthe linear search method to find the index of an element 

Assignment7: This code creates a class template used to define other classes based on the defined template which reduces redundant code

Assignment8: This code deisplays the entry of a user and outputs, It utilizes the principles of the inheritance in other to reduce recreating of code by creating a dervied class which takes from a base class

Assignment9: This program prompts the user to provide with a list of characters increase the array length and capacity after each loop. This code uses the principles of dynamic array which gives a flexibility to grow or reduce the array when executing the program

Assignment10: This code implements a linked list of interger numbers. The codes findd , insert , delete and print the values present in the linked list
