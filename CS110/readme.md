# CS 110 - Introduction to C++ Programming
This is repository contains my the codes done during my introduction to C++ class where i learnt the basics, fundamentals and the main idea of coding which was to solve the idea one at a time while focusing on getting the main goal of the project

This repository Contains 4 files which are: 

Assignnet 1 - This code was to prompts the user for an amount of consonants and vowels, generates them randomly, scrambles them, and presents the resulting string to the user

Assignment 2 - This C++ program predicts the molecular geometry of molecules based on formulas using symbols and values taken from the input file it also outputs the geometrical shape of the system, the symbol of the element while also outputing the number of bonding domains

Assignment 3 - This code use utilizes functions and function call in other to make code easier and help the user to determine the winner using the logic of craps

Assignmnt 4 - This code determines the condition of and individuals heamoglobin genes and also if individuals are related. The codes stores the blood samples in an array and uses funstions and if statements to determine rhe condition of the individual and also determine if two individuals are related
